        <h2>What Economy exactly is? What is CryptoCurrency? Should I take the risk of investing in CryptoCurrency?</h2>
        <h3>Here in this platform all the questions are answered and in an interactive way!!</h3>
        <h3>Lets get an idea what is Economy? why is it so important?</h3>
        <p>
            Economics is important for many areas of society. It can help improve living standards and make society a better place. Economics is like science in that <br>
            it can be used to improve living standards and also to make things worse. It partly depends on the priorities of society and what we consider most<br>
            important.Nearly 60% of India's GDP is driven by domestic private consumption. The country remains the world's sixth-largest consumer market.

        <h3>Ok, Now lets learn Why CryptoCurrency is an key feature for economy?</h3>
        <p>
            A key economic feature of a cryptocurrency system is that mining is a public good, while double spending to defraud the cryptocurrency depends on<br>
             individual incentives to reverse a particular transaction

        <h3>Hope you got the point :)! Now, we got to know what? but now we gotta learn why? and how? and is it worth investing in cryto?</h3>
        <p>
            Investing in crypto assets is risky but also potentially extremely profitable. Cryptocurrency is a good investment if you want to gain direct exposure <br>
            to the demand for digital currency, while a safer but potentially less lucrative alternative is to buy the stocks of companies with exposure to cryptocurrency.
        </p>
        <h3>Now question is Why cryptocurrency?</h3>
        <p>
            The main point of cryptocurrency is to fix the problems of traditional currencies by putting the power and responsibility in the currency holders' hands. <br>
            All of the cryptocurrencies adhere to the 5 properties and 3 functions of money. They each also attempt to solve one or more real-world problems.
        </p>
        <h3>Now hopefully all the concepts are clear! Now where and which CryptoCurrency do i invest in?</h3>
        <p>
            Here is an article to help you a little bit with knowledge about 
            <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=economy&type=icon">How to invest in cryptocurrency.</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Now comes the question What are the other ways to gain cryptocurrencies?</h3>
        <p>
            Crypto mining refers to the process of gaining cryptocurrencies by solving cryptographic equations with the use of high-power computers. <br>
            The solving process comprises verifying data blocks and adding transaction records to a public record (ledger) known as a blockchain.

        <h3>At last, Here are the few tips before investing in cryptocurrencies:</h3><br>
        <p>
            <h3>1. Start out Small</h3><br>
The first of our bitcoin trading tips is to proceed with caution and start with a relatively small investment.<br>

Although it’s an exciting market with a reputation for making the lucky few substantial profits in a short time frame, it is by no means easy to trade bitcoin, and there’s huge risk involved.<br>

Cryptocurrencies, in general, are extremely volatile. Avoid the temptation to go in all guns blazing and, instead, opt for small-stake trades that allow you to get a handle on the market with minimal risk.<br>

Of course, the best of all bitcoin tips is to never trade with more than you can afford to lose.<br><br>

<h3>2. Choose a Secure Wallet</h3><br>
Your bitcoin wallet is a holding pen for your digital assets so it’s important to choose wisely to ensure security and ease of access.<br>

There are multiple options out there, all with their own features and functionality.<br>

For beginner traders, it’s advisable to trade through a reputable broker , such as Coinbase, and use the wallet they provide. If you’re looking to choose your own wallet, though, you’ll need to decide which type is right for you.<br>

Wallets are described as either hot or cold:<br>

Hot wallets are connected to the internet and subsequently open to hackers<br>
Cold wallets store your assets offline and are generally considered more secure<br>
If you want instant access and are only holding a small amount of bitcoin, a hot wallet should suffice so long as you double-check the reputation of the provider. When holding bitcoin of high value, it’s best to opt for a cold wallet.<br>

Ideally, you would utilise both, keeping a limited amount readily available, with the bulk of your funds kept safely offline.<br><br>

<h3>3. Research the Market</h3><br>
The only sure-fire way to become a successful bitcoin trader is to do your homework and get to know the market.<br>

This is not a straightforward process as many of the practices used to evaluate other financial markets do not apply to bitcoin. It’s a largely speculative field and the effects of global news and events on bitcoin value are very unpredictable.<br>

That said, there are steps you can take to broaden your understanding.<br>

Technical analysis is a key research skill so take the time to practice reading charts and identifying patterns to inform your trading strategies.<br>

You should also be wary of bitcoin tips from other traders. The nature of the market means many people are waiting to profit from the inexperienced. These same people are all too happy to tell you the ‘right time to buy’ in the hope of pumping value so they can exit on a big win. Never take advice on face value and do your due diligence before entering a trade.<br><br>

<h3>4. Decide on a Trading Strategy</h3><br>
Before you even think about opening a position, you should put careful thought into the type of trader you want to be. This will depend largely on the amount of time you have to commit to trading activity and market analysis, and how quickly you’re looking to turn a profit.<br>

Bitcoin traders typically fall into one of four categories:<br>

Scalpers are the most active, making multiple trades per day for small profits.<br>

Day traders enter and exit the market within 24 hours, taking advantage of short term market movements.<br>

Another technique is swing trading, which is based on in-depth technical analysis to capture trends in the market.<br>

Finally, you may want to be a passive trader, holding on to your positions with a focus on long term profit.<br>

The benefits of this last approach are discussed in number eight of our bitcoin trading tips.<br><br>


<h3>5. Be Strict With Profit Targets and Stop-Loss Orders</h3><br>
As mentioned, bitcoin is unpredictably volatile, more so than any other financial instrument, so it’s vital to have a plan and stick to it.<br>

Before opening a position, consider what level of profit you would be happy to take from the trade, what losses you can afford to shoulder, and set your target and stop-loss levels right from the start.<br>

This is one of the most important tips, as without a disciplined approach it’s all too easy to expose yourself to potentially devastating movement.<br>

Many beginner traders fall victim to greed, holding on to a position for further profit only to see prices plummet, whilst others optimistically convince themselves that a downward trend will reverse as they fall deeper into the loss zone.<br>

By being strict with your profit targets and stop-loss orders, you can easily avoid this pitfall and minimise risk.<br><br>

<h3>6. Use Leverage With Extreme Caution</h3><br>
Leverage enables you to hold a much higher stake in a trade than the actual capital in your account would otherwise allow. Though this may seem appealing, and can indeed lend itself to significant profit, it can also lead to huge losses if a leveraged trade was to turn against you.<br>

Successful use of leverage is a balancing act between risk and reward and takes practice to master.<br>

For bitcoin beginners, leverage is best used with extreme caution and preferably avoided altogether, at least until you have developed your confidence and trading style.<br>

Only the most experienced traders with sound market knowledge should adopt leverage as part of their bitcoin trading strategy.<br><br>



<h3>7. Diversify With Different Cryptocurrencies</h3><br>
The most important bitcoin trading tips are those that focus on mitigating risk, and diversifying your portfolio is one such tip.<br>

Too many first-time traders develop an obsession with bitcoin’s potential and fail to address its downfalls.<br>

By trading in other cryptocurrencies, you hedge your investments. If one falls in value, your loss may be offset from profit on another.<br>

Diversification can also boost your profits in good market conditions. If you’ve invested wisely, you could well find yourself holding multiple assets of high value.<br>

It’s important not to over dilute your portfolio, though. You still need to assign a worthwhile amount of capital to each trade. Find a balance that reasonably increases your profit potential whilst simultaneously minimising your exposure in any one cryptocurrency.<br><br>

<h3>8.Buy and Hold Bitcoin</h3><br>
As discussed earlier, there are several types of bitcoin trading strategies. The buy and hold approach is a passive strategy where positions are held anywhere from weeks to years.<br>

There are multiple benefits to this:<br>

Buying and holding bitcoin allows you to bypass its short-term volatility. It’s not unusual to see significant movement throughout any given day which can mean your stop loss and take profit targets are easily met, throwing you out of your trade.<br>

This, in turn, can lead to overtrading, and since opening a new position is costly, overtrading can seriously eat into your profits.<br>

As a passive trader, you can keep your position open and potentially earn a good profit with little time commitment, but you still need to have a robust risk-management strategy in place, with carefully considered stop-loss orders.<br>


<h3>9. Get a Handle on Your Emotions</h3><br><br>
Alongside bitcoin trading tips involving risk management and strategy, there are also emotional factors that you need to be aware of, most notably, the fear of missing out (FOMO).<br>

Due to bitcoin’s extreme volatility, it is not unusual to see dramatic price spikes in a very short space of time and it can be tempting to buy-in to an upward trend, fearing you’ll miss out on major profit if you don’t.<br>

However, this goes against the most basic rule of trading – buy low, sell high.<br>

If bitcoin has skyrocketed, it’s likely you’ve already missed the advantageous point of the upward trend, and you’ll end up paying a premium for an asset that will inevitably decrease in value, placing you at a significant loss.<br>

Falling victim to FOMO is one of the main reasons so many beginner traders fail. Be wary and accept that some profitable opportunities just weren’t meant for you.<br><br>

<h3>10. Watch out for Scammers</h3><br>
With no central exchange and little regulation in place, the bitcoin market is, unfortunately, an ideal environment for scammers.<br>

Fake exchanges and wallets are common, as are phishing scams where fraudulent emails direct you to scam sites identical to the platforms you use to capture sensitive data.<br>

Ponzi schemes, which work on a pyramid structure, offer increased returns for investors that recruit other investors and should be avoided at all costs.<br>

Malware is, of course, another issue and without proper security measures around your bitcoin wallet, you leave yourself open to the threat of having your account emptied.<br>

These are just some of the scams to watch out for and, as bitcoin trading is such an open, complicated and relatively new market, new threats pop up regularly.<br>

So, the last of our 10 bitcoin trading tips is to keep your wits about you, be aware of anything untoward and put robust safety measures into action.<br><br>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3><br>
Whatever type of bitcoin trading strategy you plan on adopting, you must place security and risk-management measures at its core.<br>

As it is such a volatile market, the potential for both profit and loss is high and first-time traders should never invest more than they can afford to lose.<br>

You should use these bitcoin trading tips alongside other trusted resources to ensure you have a good grasp of the market and its pitfalls, understand how to conduct strategic technical analysis and can compile a detailed risk-management plan to give yourself the best chance of becoming a successful bitcoin trader.<br>
